* Blang (Burmese programming language)
This is a programming language backed by ruby. The project is just for my research to validate how much it is possible to write a programming lanague in burmese.
I have no intention to make the language super performant or make it as a production ready language at the time.
I may rewrite the language in C if the language got enough attention. Currently implementation should not be used at production at any costs. 

* Example 
#+BEGIN_SRC
အခန်း NewClass
 a = "abc" 
 b = ၁ - ၂ + ၃ + ၄
 f = မှား
 အကို  = နတ္ထိ
 n = "data"
 ကြေညာချက် k()
    10
 ပြီး

 ပြ(f)
 ပြ(n)
 ပြ(အကို) 
 ပြ(b+k())
 ပြ("This is awesome item")

ပြီး
#+END_SRC
